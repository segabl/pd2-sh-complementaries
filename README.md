# Streamlined Heisting Complements

Complementary skill changes to go with Streamlined Heisting

## Skill changes

### Mastermind

#### Medic

- Inspire
  - Ace: Cooldown 20s -> 60s

*Inspire's cooldown is low enough to not really matter, the time it takes for someone to go into custody when downed is longer than the cooldown.*
*A cooldown increase should make Inspire less abusable*

#### Controller

- Partners In Crime
  - Basic: Damage reduction 45% -> 40%
  - Ace: Damage reduction 54% -> 50%

*Jokers in general are a low effort way to gain strong benefits and Partners In Crime is giving too much damage reduction combined with the changed health granularity in Streamlined Heisting.*
*Reducing the damage reduction will force players to take new Jokers more frequently.*

#### Sharpshooter

- Aggressive Reload
  - Ace: Reload speed increase 100% -> 75%

*The reload speed increase of Aggressive Reload seems a bit extreme for something as basic as hitting headshots.*

- Graze
  - Ace: Damage on headshot 100% -> 90%

*Graze is a strong room clearing ability and giving 100% of the damage to close enemies makes it not very strategic to use.*
*Slightly reducing the damage on a headshot kill will encourage players to shoot higher health targets first.*

### Enforcer

#### Shotgunner

- Overkill
  - Basic: Duration 20s -> 8s

*Overkill's duration is way too long for the strong bonus damage it provides.*
*Reducing the duration will force players to engage with enemies more.*

#### Ammo Specialist

- Bullet Storm
  - Fixed increased duration when ammo bag was used up
  - Ace: Duration increase 15s -> 10s

*Depending on the ammo bag upgrades, Bullet Storm had comically long durations when the bag was used up due to a bug.*
*The intended duration also seems a tad too long, providing large benefits for a low skill point cost.*

- Saw Massacre
  - Basic: Reduced wear 50% -> 95%

*Saw Massacre is a useless skill and 50% reduced wear is not enough to make the saw a viable weapon against enemies.*
*Decreasing the wear further will make it more viable at least in some cases.*

- Fully Loaded
  - Ace: Throwable pickup chance increase 1% -> 5%

*The chance increase is multiplied with the base chance instead of added, which makes it completely negligible as it takes 70 ammo pickups to even reach 10% chance.*
*With a chance increase of 5%, reaching more meaningful chance numbers will be possible.*

### Technician

#### Breacher

- Hardware Expert
  - Changed drill auto restart chance to trigger everytime the drill breaks instead of on drill placement
  - Auto restart delay 5s to 20s -> 5s to 10s
  - Ace: Auto restart chance 10% -> 20%

*Auto restart is an inconsistent mechanic as it only has a chance to apply once when the drill is placed. This means if you were lucky you would not need to look after the drill at all, while if you were unlucky, the skill would not do anything for you.*
*Changing the mechanic to have a chance to trigger everytime the drill breaks and increasing the restart chance makes the skill less luck based.*

- More Firepower
  - Basic: Shaped charges 1 -> 2
  - Ace: Shaped charges 2 -> 3

*While the tripmine part of the skill is fine, the amount of shaped charges you get is not really great considering how little use they have on most heists.*
*Increasing the amount from a maximum of 6 to 8 will give the skill more value on heists that have use for shaped charges.*

- Kickstarter
  - Basic: Auto restart chance 20% -> 30%

*See notes on Hardware Expert.*

#### Oppressor

- Body Expertise
  - Basic: Damage 30% -> 25%
  - Ace: Damage 90% -> 65%

*Body Expertise gives too much value for very low effort.*
*Reducing the damage percentage should bring the skill more in line.*

### Ghost

#### Silent Killer

- Optical Illusions
  - Basic: Trageting chance decrease 35% -> 20%

*Optical Illusions is a niche skill but it provides slightly too much value when it's used with Jokers.*

- Unseen Strike
  - Basic: Crit duration 6s -> 4s
  - Ace: Crit duration 18s -> 12s

*The duration for crits is a bit too long, given that part of the skill's description is wrong and you do not lose the bonus on getting hit.*

### Fugitive

- Bloodthirst
  - Basic and Ace skill swapped
  - Basic: Reload speed increase 50% for 10s -> 30% for 4s
  - Ace: Damage increase +100% up to 1600% -> +50% up to 800%

*Bloodthirst provides a way too strong bonus for a basic skill that involves no effort to gain as the requirement for it is something you do anyways.*
*Swapping the basic and ace version and reducing the numbers should bring this skill more in line.*

- Pumping Iron
  - Basic: Damage increase 100% -> 200%
  - Ace: Damage increase 100% -> 150%

*Pumping Iron could do with a little numbers increase, especially with Bloodthirst nerfed.*
*Increasing the damage will make it possible to reach similar damage numbers against non specials in combination with Bloodthirst.*

- Berserker
  - Swapped with Frenzy

*Berserker provides a very strong benefit that is a bit too easy to reach in the skilltree.*
*Swapping Berserker and Frenzy makes investing into it a bit more costly.*

- Frenzy
  - Swapped with Berserker

*See notes on Berserker.*
